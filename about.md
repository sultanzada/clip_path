[comment]: # (I wanted to choose the video title from the above keyboards Like "Flutter custom ClipPath tutorial", but as I saw your latest videos in the channel for any widget, you selected a simple title name, for example for SizedBox widget you just gave a title name just as "Flutter SizedBox")
- Video Title: Flutter ClipPath

**Great Features**
- A Widget that clips its child using a path and calling a callback on a delegate whenever the widget is to be painted. The callback returns a path and the widget prevents the child from painting outside the path. In this article, we will get into ClipPath Widget in detail.
- The ClipPath Widget has clipper property which takes a CustomClipper to define how it is going to clip its path. Inside the CustomClipper thereâ€™s getClip(Size size) method where you can define how you are going to clip the child.
- **lineTo:** Using this method one can cut the widget with a line from the given point . x and y are two destinations points where the line stops.
- **quadraticBeizerTo:** with the help of quadraticBeizer method, you can clip your widget with curves.we can draw a quadratic bezier curve using the control point and endpoint.
- We can create a customClipperPath using [shapeMaker](https://shapemaker.web.app/#/)

**Problems from Video**
- can you give shadow to the custom clip path?
- how to make a custom shadow that will fill the whole shape? I know I can use elevation from draw.Shadow with a Custom Painter but I want a uniform shadow over the whole container
- what was the use of moveTo in your code? I removed it and nothing changed
- please tell me how to know this measurement for creating the customClipperPath ?
- can you please explain 'cubic to' also it would be very helpful
- What's the difference between custom paint and custom clipper, because we can even develop this with custom paint, so why use custom clipper
- Why / When would you return true / false for the 'shouldReclip()' function?
- When the clipping is done, the container area remains the same, but in a phantom, how can I get rid of the invisible space permanently?
